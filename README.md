# vue_weather_app

This weather app was built in Vue.js following Tyler Potts tutorial on YouTube. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLc-hWsPTUY

I followed this tutorial to help solidify what I was learning and get some practise building a Vue.js app.

By following this tutorial, I was able to learn the following:

- How to dynamically change the background of the web page using :class
- About the derivatives - v-if and v-model
- How to save the results of an API request in Vue.js
- How to display variables on your webpage
- The `@keyup.enter` function to call a function when the enter key is pressed, which I imagine will be important for future applications I build
